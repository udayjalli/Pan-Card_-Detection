# 🧾 PAN Card Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to **detect and extract information from Indian PAN cards**. It can identify whether a given image contains a PAN card and optionally extract key fields like PAN number, Name, and Date of Birth using OCR techniques.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Detects PAN cards from images or scanned documents
- 🧠 Uses a trained ML model (e.g., SVM, CNN, etc.) for classification
- 🔤 Extracts PAN number and other details using Tesseract OCR (optional)
- 🔍 Validates extracted text using regular expressions

Let me know if you'd like me to modify this with:
- Your real name or GitHub link
- The actual model/approach you used (SVM, CNN, etc.)
- Any code snippets or output examples

I can even generate the `requirements.txt` file for you if needed.
